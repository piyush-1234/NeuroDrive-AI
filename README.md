NeuroDrive AI is an advanced autonomous driving system powered by reinforcement learning, Markov decision processes (MDP), and deep Q-networks (DQN). 
Unlike traditional rule-based self-driving models, it employs a non-deterministic approach, enabling it to adapt to unpredictable road conditions dynamically.
By leveraging experience replay, NeuroDrive AI refines its decision-making over time, learning from past actions to optimize real-world driving behavior. 
The integration of deep neural networks allows the AI to process complex environments, make intelligent driving choices, and enhance safety.
NeuroDrive AI is designed to simulate human-like decision-making, ensuring smooth, efficient, and intelligent autonomous navigation. ðŸš—ðŸ’¡
